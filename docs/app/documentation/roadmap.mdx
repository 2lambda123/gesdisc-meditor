# Roadmap

-   there's a repo with md files that uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with plugins to generate output very useful to users
-   we'd like to take the existing work that's done and, changing that workflow as little as possible, integrate the result of those documents into this documentation engine
-   https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/GESDISC/repos/gesdisc-use-cases/browse
-   https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/
-   https://www.mkdocs.org/
