## Working with Documents

Most documents must go through the standard [workflow](#workflows) (add/edit > review > publish). What you are allowed to do with a document is determined by roles. Roles are assigned by model types (e.g., some users have authoring privileges for alerts, while others have authoring privileges for how-to documents). Roles consist of an author, reviewer and a publisher. If you are an author, you will be able to create new documents, edit existing documents, make comments, resolve comments, and submit a document for review. If you are a reviewer, you are able to make comments, resolve comments, and indicate the document is ready for publication or needs additional work. If you are a publisher, you can make comments, resolve comments, and publish the document. See [Workflows & Roles](#workflows-and-roles) and [Using Comments](#using-comments) for a more detailed explanation. To find out what roles you are currently assigned, see [Determining Your Roles](#determining-your-roles). If you need additional roles for other models, submit a Bugzilla ticket and choose "Meditor" as the product and then select the appropriate component ([https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor](https://discette.gsfc.nasa.gov/tt/enter_bug.cgi?product=mEditor)).

### Adding a Document

Before you can add a new document, you must have the role of author for the specific model type (e.g., news, howto's, etc).

1. From the mEditor [Home screen](#meditor-home-screen) select the model type you wish to add. This will take you to the document listing page for that model.
1. Click the "\+ Add New" button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. A blank editing form for that model type will be presented.
1. Enter information into the input fields. Required fields are denoted by an \* and must be completed before the "Save" button is enabled and the document can be saved.
1. Click the "Save" button.

Your document is now saved and is in the "Draft" state. An initial version of the document is created in the [History](#versions-and-history) panel. You can reopen the document to make additional [edits](#editing-a-document-and-submitting-it-for-review).

#### Submitting a Document for Review

To submit a document for review, click "Submit for Review" button. If you made any changes, they are saved and submitted for review. The document's state is changed from "Draft" to "Under Review".

You and a reviewer will use the [Comments](#using-comments) and [History](#versions-and-history) features to refine the document until it is ready for publication. Each time you reopen the document to make additional edits and save those edits, the document reverts to a "Draft" state and needs to be re-submitted for review. Any comments associated with the previous version of the document are retained and maintained in that specific version and will not appear in your latest draft. This is all part of the review process.

NOTE: Documents in mEditor will NOT look the same as when they are published to their application targets. For example, the visual layout of a UUI news article is completely different than that of the UUI news document as shown in mEditor. The only way to see a UUI news article as it will look in UUI, is to publish it to UUI.
