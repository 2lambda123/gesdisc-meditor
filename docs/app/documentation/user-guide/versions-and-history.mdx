## Versions and History

Each time you edit and save a document, mEditor creates a new version. These versions can be viewed by opening the "History" button at the top of the editing form. The versions are listed in chronological order with the latest version appearing at the top of the list. Each version is date and time stamped and also shows the author that edited that version of the document.

NOTE: The History button appears on "Saved" documents only.

When you edit a document, mEditor opens the latest version, however you may view or edit an older version. This can be useful if you want to recover older content that has been deleted or modified. You can step back through history by opening the History panel and clicking on a previous version. The edit form will display the selected version.

WARNING: Editing an older version of a document and then saving those changes will make this older version the "current" version of the document. This new current version will not contain any edits that occurred above it in the historical record.
