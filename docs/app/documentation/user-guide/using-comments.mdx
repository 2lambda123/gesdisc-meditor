## Using Comments

mEditor uses a comment feature to allow authors, reviewers, and publishers to collaborate on refining documents as they make their way through the [workflow](#workflows) process. It's functions very similar to the comments feature seen in Google applications. Comments are used to suggest revisions to a document, which results in subsequent edits until all of the comments are [resolved](#resolving-a-comment).

NOTE: The Comment button appears on "Saved" documents only.

NOTE: It is important to understand that comments are tied to the version of the document in which they were made. If a edits are made to a version of a document that has comments, a new "comment-free" version is made and any comments associated with the previous version of the document are retained and maintained in that specific version. They will not appear in your latest draft.
