# Jupyter Notebook Embed - CKEditor Plugin

A plugin for embedding a rendered Jupyter notebook in web content.

## How it works

-   Enter a URL to a .ipynb notebook.
-   Prepends a Jupyter NBViewer (https://nbviewer.org/) URL to it
-   Embeds an iframe into the web content that loads the rendered notebook from NBViewer
