The system is moving ever so slowly to the West/Northwest back to dumping more precipitation on the East and central areas of Florida. Tropical Strom Fay is moving very slowly, around 2 mph, so flooding is expected to continue across Florida with effects from the storm lasting through the weekend. We still need to keep an eye on what happens to the storm after it passes over Florida to see if it moves back over water or if it moves far enough in the Northwest direction to weaken.
